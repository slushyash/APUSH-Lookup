Glossary

1. capitalism: An economic system based on the investment of resources (money, capital) in various enterprises in the hope of making a profit.

2. demography: The statistical study of human populations, especially with reference to size, density, distribution, and vital statistics such as sex or family size. Using computers to store, sort, and retrieve the considerable data available to them, historians have conducted complex demographic studies and shed new light on social life in early America.

3. feudalism: A political, social, and economic system that existed in Europe during the Middle Ages. Based on the ownership of land and the obligations of tenant to lord, feudalism tended to fragment power and authority. By the end of the fifteenth century, it was being replaced by centralized governments in nation-states, but aspects of the feudal system remained in parts of Europe for centuries.

4. high church: The party within the Church of England that retained many of the Catholic ceremonies and practices that the Puritans opposed and wished to purge from the church.
Before European explorers arrived in the Americas, Native Americans had developed their own forms of social organizations,
which differed from one another in their levels of achievement. Europeans, concerned first with exploiting the New World and
its peoples, regarded the natives as savages and set out to destroy their societies and replace them with a variation of European
culture. Helped in this by the biological disaster brought on by smallpox and other diseases, the Europeans were able to
conquer the tribes and civilizations and impose on the Indians a number of different colonial systems. To help make up for the
Indians' labor lost through conquest and epidemic, Europeans brought in African slaves, who added to the cultural diversity of
America. Conflicts in the old world spilled over into the New as different nations got into the race for colonies. By the end of the
sixteenth century, the age of discovery was all but over, and the great era of colonization, especially English colonization, was
about to begin.
